Super Pivot FREE modifier is the FREE version of Super Pivot PRO modifier which include more advanced features.
PRO version: http://u3d.as/Cgx


When manipulating the pivot of your GameObjects, please make sure that the Transform toggle button of Unity is set in "Pivot" mode. This way Unity will place the transform gizmos at the proper pivot position. Otherwise, in "Center" mode, Unity will place the gizmos at the center of the GameObject's renderer bounds: this may be confusing when manipulating the pivot with SuperPivot. For more information, check the official Unity documentation: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PositioningGameObjects.html (@ "Gizmo handle position toggles").

***********************
Edit Pivot in Editor
***********************
By default, Super Pivot overrides your Transform Inspector to add a "Move Pivot" button and let you quickly edit the pivot of your GameObjects.
If you don't want this behavior, simply delete the "Plugins/SuperPivot/Editor/TransformCustomInspector.cs" file.

You still can use SuperPivot using the standalone Window accessible through "Tools/Super Pivot" menu.


***********************
Multi-Object Editing
***********************
Multi-Object Editing is not supported in the Super Pivot FREE version


Super Pivot also offers you a convenient Component "Show Pivot" (located in "Plugins/SuperPivot" folder). You can drag it over any of your GameObjects to visualize their pivot position in the scene view.
